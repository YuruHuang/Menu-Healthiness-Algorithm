This repository contains analytical scripts for our recent paper on assessing menu healthiness at scale. The goal of this project was to use machine learning algorithm to predict the menu healthiness of out-of-home food outlets in the Great Britain, including those without an online presence, and to investigate the socioeconomic patterning of menu healthiness.

## Data Collection
The Data Collection folder contains the scripts used to collect the menu data from JustEat in 2021. Please note that we are unable to share the Points-of-Interests data and scraped Just Eat menu due to the nature of our data.

## Machine Learning Experiments
The Machine Learning Experiments folder contains the scripts for the multiple experiments conducted to find the best-performing algorithm to predict menu healthiness of out-of-home food outlets. 

## Analysis Code 
The Analysis Code folder contains the analysis code used in the paper. 

## Usage
To use the scripts in this repository, clone or download the repository to your local machine.
